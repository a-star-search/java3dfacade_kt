This project provides a wrapper/facade for Shape3D objects and the points from which they are created.

Java 3D classes can be too low level and their creation involves a fair amount of boilerplate code. 

This holds the original list of points of a polygon, provides a default appearance if one
is not explicitly defined, hides boilerplate code and provides some other utility functions.
